### [Fine-tuning BERT for sequence classification](https://github.com/taijackt/BERT_fake_news_classification)
> This project is originally done on kaggle notebook and then modified. 
- Fine tuning a BERT to classify fake news (Chinese language).
- Two sentences A & Bã€€would be given to the model, the model will classify whether they are `agreed`, `disagreed` or `unrelated`.

### [Mask Detection with Faster RCNN (Pytorch) (transfer learning)](https://github.com/taijackt/Mask-detection-RCNN)
> This project is originall done on kaggle notebook and then modified. [link](https://www.kaggle.com/jackttai/face-mask-detection-faster-r-cnn-pytorch)
- Faster RCNN is used for transfer learning.
- To detect whether a person is wearing mask or not wearing mask.

### [People counting system with YOLOv5](https://github.com/taijackt/People-Counting-with-yolov5) (Not yet finish uploading)
> Counting people in/out using YOLOv5 and centroid tracker.
- A simple people counting system with around 30 fps in average.
- The counting data is saved in local using mongoDB.
- API is provided for getting the data.


### Simple People Re-identification system (Not yet finish uploading)
> A simple people re-identification system using torchreid, YOLOv5 and motrackers.
- The camera in entracne will capture the images of people.
- The camera in exit will capture the image and do re-identification with the images saved by the first camera.
- Can be used in queue management to record their waiting time.

> All the projects are belowed are done on kaggle and not yet modified into a github repo.
